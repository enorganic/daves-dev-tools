# daves-dev-tools

This project provides command line utilities for performing common python
development tasks.

## Installation

You can install daves-dev-tools with pip:

```shell
pip3 install daves-dev-tools
```

In order to use some features of this library, you will need to specify
one or more *extras*:
- "cerberus": This extra installs requirements needed in order to import
  `daves_dev_tools.cerberus`, which provides utilities for interacting
  with a [Cerberus](https://engineering.nike.com/cerberus/) vault.
  ```shell
  pip3 install daves-dev-tools[cerberus]
  ```

To install this project for development of *this library*,
clone this repository (replacing "~/Code", below, with the directory
under which you want your project to reside), then run `make`:
```shell script
cd ~/Code && \
git clone\
 https://github.com/davebelais/daves-dev-tools.git\
 daves-dev-tools && \
